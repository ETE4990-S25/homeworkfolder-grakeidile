# # Variables
# 

# Variables are containers for storing data values. 
# 
# Creating variables in Python is very simple: we type the name of the variable, then an equals sign, then put the value that we are assigning to that variable on the right of equals sign.
# 
# A variable in Python can hold any type of data, this could be a primitive value (a number or
# character), or an object (a string, sprite, list, etc).

# In[1]:


score = 0
name = "Mr. Powers"
aList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
aTuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)


# ## Rules of Variables
# 
#     Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. 
#     
#     Note: They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.

# In[2]:


message_1 = "correct"


# In[3]:


1_message = "incorrect"


# In[4]:


message2@="incorrect"


#     Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names.

# In[5]:


greeting_message = "correct"
greeting message = "incorrect"


#     Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; 
#     Do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose
# | | | | | |
# |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
# |False| class| finally|is|return|
# |None|continue|for|lambda|try|
# |True|def|from|nonlocal|while|
# |and|del|global|not|with|
# |as|elif|if|or|yield|
# |assert|else|import|pass| |
# |break|except|in|raise| |
# 

# In[11]:


#print="Correct but dont use"
print("blabla")
aand = "incorrect"
print(aand + 'Hello')
print(aand)
print(aand)


#     Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.
# 

# In[12]:


n = "bad"
name = "good"
s = "bad"
s_n = "bad"
student_name = "good"
length_of_persons_name = "ok"
name_length = 'better'


#     Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.

# In[13]:


message = "this will not work"
print(mesage)


# In[14]:


mesage = 'HELLO ETE 4990!'
print(mesage)
print("You can also do this", mesage)
print(mesage.title())
print(mesage.find("4"))


# ## Methods

# A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. 
# 
# The dot after the mesage tells Python to perform the title() method on the variable. 
# 
# It is important to note that a method is allwas followed by a set of parentheses. In many cases the method needs additional information to perform an action. 
# 
# In this case the parentheses are empty but wat about the method print()
# 

# # Print Statments

# In[15]:


print("Score: ", score, type(score),"  Name: ", name, type(name), 
      "  A List:", aList, type(aList), "  A Tuple:", aTuple, type(aTuple))
print("\tScore:\t", score, type(score))
print("\tName:\t", name, type(name))
print("\tA List:\t", aList, type(aList))
print("\tA Tuple:", aTuple, type(aTuple))


# In[20]:


print(name,str(score))
#help(print)
print(name,str(score), sep="")


# ## Global and Local variables

# In Python it is fairly simple to create and assign values to variables, however it is a little more complex to use them. Here we will discuss what is known as scope .
# 
# Scope is the area of code in a program where a certain (variable) name is valid, meaning itcan be used.
# 
# Mainly there are 2 types of scopes for variables Global and Local

# ## if statments

# An If statment is the heart of every function. It is a conditional test and it uses the values of True and False to deside to exicute the code. 

# In[ ]:


name == "Mr. Powers"


# In[ ]:


name == "MR. Powers"


# In[ ]:

# An if statment has the following setup
# 
# ```python
#     if conditional_test:
#        do something 
# ```
