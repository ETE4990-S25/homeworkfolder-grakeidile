    "- **Player Type Selection**: Allow players to choose their character type. Set attributes based on the choice (e.g., wizard: magic = 10, knight: magic = 0).\n",
    "- **Inventory Display**: Implement a function to show the player's inventory.\n",
    "- **Item Details**: Write a function to provide detailed information about an inventory item (e.g., Knife: \"forged in the depths of Polymar\", +5 magic, edged weapon, one-handed).\n",

    "- **Concepts**: Utilize functions, loops, arrays, classes, and constants. You may also use files and structs if desired.\n",
    "- **Player Type Selection**: Allow players to choose their character type and set attributes accordingly (e.g., wizard: magic = 10, knight: magic = 0).\n",
